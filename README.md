# ENHANCING-DEF-DRIVER-SAFETY-
The aim of the paper is to introduce a horn detection system that can be recognizing 
the horn sound and its direction for a safety four-wheel driving. This system can help deaf persons 
as well as the persons who were difficult to find in which side the vehicles are overtaking them 
during driving. The flashing lights are the visual cues to which Deaf people pay attention while 
driving, but honking horns does not inhibit any visual cues. For the safety of deaf people and to 
reduce the discrimination of society about deaf people driving, there is a need of a device that will 
alert deaf drivers and indicate them from which side the sound is coming. To build that desired 
device, the Arduino Uno board is used as a microcontroller to acquire the sound signal.
